# Introduction

This guide demonstrates how to work with data from the Midlatitude Allsky-imaging Network for GeoSpace Observations (MANGO).
MANGO is a network of all-sky cameras and Fabry-Perot Interferometers to observe wave activity in the thermosphere {cite}`Bhatt2023`.
More information can be found on the [MANGO Network](https://www.mangonetwork.org/mango/v1/) website.
